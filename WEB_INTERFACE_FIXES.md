- [ ] Audit and standardize all CSS breakpoints
- [ ] Fix inconsistent column layouts at various screen sizes
- [ ] Create consistent typography scale across breakpoints
- [ ] Ensure proper image scaling on different devices
- [ ] Fix overflow issues in container elements

### 2. Touch Interface
- [ ] Increase touch target sizes for mobile interfaces
- [ ] Fix hover states that don't work on touch devices
- [ ] Add gesture support for common interactions
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing between interactive elements
- [ ] Fix scrolling issues in overflow containers

### 3. Form Factors
- [ ] Test and fix layout on tablets and large phones
- [ ] Ensure landscape orientation is properly supported
- [ ] Fix font sizing issues on high-DPI displays
- [ ] Create print stylesheets for portfolio reports
- [ ] Test with screen readers and fix accessibility issues

## Testing Requirements Before Mobile Development

### 1. Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Address any browser-specific CSS or JavaScript issues
- [ ] Ensure consistent rendering of charts and visualizations
- [ ] Fix any performance issues in specific browsers
- [ ] Test with browser extensions that might interfere

### 2. Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure and optimize page load times
- [ ] Identify and fix JavaScript performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize API call patterns to reduce latency
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical content
- [ ] Test performance on lower-end devices

### 3. Security Testing
- [ ] Conduct XSS and CSRF vulnerability checks
- [ ] Test token security and expiration handling
- [ ] Verify secure storage of sensitive data
- [ ] Implement proper CORS settings for API endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting on authentication attempts
