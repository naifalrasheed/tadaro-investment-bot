# CFA Integration Implementation

This document describes the implementation of CFA curriculum concepts into the Investment Bot application, focusing on behavioral finance and advanced portfolio analytics.

## Overview

The implementation integrates CFA-level concepts into the investment bot through:

1. **Behavioral Finance Components:**
   - User bias profiling (cognitive and emotional biases)
   - Investment decision framework with bias detection
   - Personalized debiasing strategies

2. **Advanced Portfolio Analytics:**
   - Factor-based portfolio analysis
   - Performance attribution (Brinson-Fachler methodology)
   - Efficient frontier generation and optimization

3. **Personalized User Profiling:**
   - Comprehensive risk profiling questionnaire
   - Behavioral bias assessment
   - Investment Policy Statement (IPS) generation

## Database Schema Updates

The integration adds the following database tables:

- **UserBiasProfile**: Tracks user behavioral biases
- **InvestmentDecision**: Records investment decisions with contextual data
- **UserRiskProfile**: Stores comprehensive risk profile and constraints

Additionally, the User model has been updated with:
- `has_completed_profiling` flag
- Relationships to the new tables

## Installation and Setup

Before using the new CFA features, you must update your database schema:

1. Navigate to the project's src directory
2. Run the schema update script:

```bash
python update_schema.py
```

This will add the new columns and tables needed for the CFA integration.

## Features and Usage

### User Profiling

The system now performs comprehensive user profiling based on CFA curriculum concepts:

1. New users are automatically redirected to the profiling questionnaire after registration
2. Existing users who haven't completed profiling will be redirected on login
3. Users can view their profile results at any time from the profile dropdown menu

### Behavioral Finance Integration

The behavioral finance components analyze user decisions and detect potential biases:

1. Cognitive biases (availability, recency, overconfidence, etc.)
2. Emotional biases (loss aversion, regret aversion, herding, etc.)
3. Personalized debiasing strategies

### Investment Policy Statement

Each user receives a personalized Investment Policy Statement:

1. Investment objectives based on risk tolerance
2. Risk constraints with clear parameters
3. Asset allocation targets with acceptable ranges
4. Rebalancing policy and monitoring framework

### Advanced Portfolio Analytics

The system provides CFA-level portfolio analytics:

1. Factor exposure analysis
2. Style analysis
3. Performance attribution
4. Risk-based portfolio construction

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a modular architecture:

- `behavioral_bias_analyzer.py`: Implements bias detection and profiling
- `cfa_profiler.py`: Integrates behavioral finance and portfolio analytics
- `investment_decision_framework.py`: Provides structured decision making
- `advanced_portfolio_analytics.py`: Offers sophisticated portfolio analysis

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements include:

1. Real-time bias detection during trading
2. Machine learning-based bias prediction
3. Portfolio optimization with behavioral constraints
4. ESG integration
5. Fixed income portfolio analysis
