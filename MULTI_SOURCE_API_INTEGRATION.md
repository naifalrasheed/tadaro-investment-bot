# Multi-Source API Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a multi-source data integration system that allows the Investment Bot to collect and compare stock data from multiple providers:

1. Alpha Vantage API
2. Interactive Brokers Web API
3. YFinance (fallback)

The system uses the DataComparisonService to reconcile data from different sources and select the most accurate information based on source reliability, data recency, and consistency checks.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Comparison Service
- `DataComparisonService` in `data/data_comparison_service.py`
- Compares data from multiple sources with configurable reliability weights
- Detects and resolves conflicts between data sources
- Adds metadata about data reconciliation for transparency

### 2. UI Enhancements
- Updated `templates/analysis.html` to display data source information
- Added badges to show the source of data (Alpha Vantage, Interactive Brokers, etc.)
- Added detailed reconciliation information when data is combined from multiple sources

### 3. App Integration
- Modified the `/analyze` route to fetch data from multiple sources in parallel
- Implemented reconciliation using the DataComparisonService
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Unit tests for the DataComparisonService
- Test script for Interactive Brokers integration
- Test script for multi-source data integration

To run the tests:
```bash
# Test the DataComparisonService
python -m tests.test_data_comparison

# Test the Interactive Brokers integration
python test_ib_integration.py

# Test the multi-source integration
python test_ib_integration_simple.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement parallel requests for different data sources
   - Add asynchronous processing using async/await patterns
   - Optimize caching strategies for each data source

2. **Enhanced UI Templates**
   - Add more visual indicators of data quality
   - Create a data sources configuration page
   - Implement user preference for preferred data sources

3. **Interactive Brokers Gateway Setup**
   - Create detailed documentation for gateway setup
   - Add automated detection and launching of the gateway
   - Implement automatic re-authentication

4. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Add monitoring for API call performance
   - Track data source reliability over time
   - Log reconciliation patterns to identify common conflicts

## Configuration

The system can be configured by modifying the following:

1. **Source Weights**
   - Edit `SOURCE_WEIGHTS` in `data/data_comparison_service.py`
   - Higher weight indicates higher reliability (default: IB:8, AV:7, YF:5)

2. **Reconciliation Thresholds**
   - Edit conflict detection thresholds in `data/data_comparison_service.py`
   - Default threshold for price differences is 2%, customize as needed

3. **Cache TTL Settings**
   - Edit cache expiration times in respective data clients
   - Alpha Vantage: 60 seconds for real-time data, 6 hours for historical
   - Interactive Brokers: 60 seconds for market data, 24 hours for contract details

## Known Issues

1. **Interactive Brokers Authentication**
   - IB Gateway requires manual browser authentication
   - Session timeout requires re-authentication periodically
   - Working on a more seamless authentication flow

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Alpha Vantage free tier limited to 5 calls/minute
   - Consider upgrading to premium tier for production use
   
3. **Edge Cases in Data Comparison**
   - Some stock metrics may have significant differences between sources
   - The system currently uses weighted averages, but may need more sophisticated reconciliation

## API Upgrade Recommendations

1. **Alpha Vantage Premium** ($50/month)
   - Increases rate limit from 5 calls/minute to 120-1200 calls/minute
   - Critical for production deployment with multiple users

2. **Interactive Brokers Pro API**
   - Requires brokerage account but provides more reliable data
   - Includes real-time streaming data instead of snapshots
